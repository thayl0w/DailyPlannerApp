            <h3>What is Daily Planner?</h3>
            <p>
                Daily Planner is a simple, clean web application inspired by the "Preach My Gospel" daily planner. 
                It provides a straightforward way to organize your daily activities and notes in a calendar format.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app focuses on simplicity and ease of use, offering only the essential features: a monthly calendar 
                view and the ability to save notes for each day. No complex features, no distractions—just a clean 
                interface to help you plan your day.

            <h3>How to Use</h3>
            <p>Using Daily Planner is easy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>View the Calendar:</strong> The main page displays a monthly calendar grid showing all days of the current month.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigate Months:</strong> Use the "Previous Month" and "Next Month" buttons to move between months.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a Note:</strong> Click on any day (1-31) to open a modal window where you can write and save a note for that day.</li>
                <li><strong>Save Your Note:</strong> Type your note in the text area and click the "Save" button. Your note will be stored and will appear again when you return to that day.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete a Note:</strong> If you want to remove a note, click the "Delete" button in the modal. You'll be asked to confirm before deletion.</li>
                <li><strong>View Saved Notes:</strong> Days with saved notes will show a "Note saved" indicator on the calendar.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All your notes are stored locally in your browser using localStorage, so they will persist even after you close the browser. 
                However, if you clear your browser data, your notes will be lost.
            </p>
